# "Remember when?"
The process of upgrading the motor in my brother's SJ70 Suzuki Sierra

## The Story

Well, well, well. About time I wrote some of this stuff down. I was sitting on a train the other day - Scrolling though photos, and I suddenly realised that ive done some pretty cool projects (If I say so myself!) So I started moving photos into albums so that I could get  some pen to paper (fingers to keyboard?) and write my experience down so I can share with others, and also keep as a memory!

Sooooooomewhere around 2011, my Brother purchased his Suzuki sierra, and he loved this thing. Small-form 4X4, coming in at 950kg, packing a massive 1.3L 62.5kW carby engine. The car was awesome to drive! And my brother and I spent nemourous weekends out camping and fishing. Attenting the annual Kingston surf fishing competition each year.

One beautiful summers day, we were out with a bunch of people, and we jumped the car what ill call a "brave" distance!

After this stunt, and coming out mostly unscathed (Minus a bent front differential housing), the car was taken off the road for a few major upgrades.

## The Original Plan
The original plan was big!

-1.6L EFI engine from a Suzuki Vitara

-Suzuki Swift GTI DOHC head

-Ebay turbo (heh)

All of it was coming along (slowly but surely), I remember Mum and Dad getting awfully excited when the engine came out of the shed and rolled towards the car for the first time!

The project sat around for a while, my brother got married, moved out of Mum and Dad's house into his own home, and started a family. Soon, time became a precious resource. In the middle of all this, I had moved up to Adelaide, tried out uni (Robotic Engineering), turns out uni wasnt for me, so I jumped into a trade, working as an apprentice motor mechanic for Mercedes Benz. I eventually conviced my brother to send up his car to me, so that I could finish it off for him in my spare time. 

## The Handover

We discussed the plan, and decided to simplify things. The plan changed to just drop in a complete 1.3L EFI engine from a Suzuki Swift GTI, bringing him up to 74kW. This simplified the conversion significantly, as it's a direct bolt up to the existing drivetrain, and there was atleast ***some*** scattered documentation available online from other people who have completed this.

As some parts were missing, I ended up grabing a complete engine from a wreck for ~$500ish. Sent the engine wiring loom and the cluster off to [Camms Wiring Solutions](https://www.facebook.com/cammswiringsolutions/) for him to work his magic. As life being as life doing/does, this project fell off my priority list as I moved houses and other priorities came up. Suddenly, I found myself in a similar situation as my brother, time becoming a precious resource. At the same time, I was trying to work a 9-5 as a mechanic, and also do after hours "Cashies" so I had an extra bit of pocket money.

Time was fleeing, one sunday morning I was having a coffee out the back of the house with my partner, and we decided that the car had to go. Well, not "go", but I had to dedicate some serious time to finishing this car. This was about 8 weeks out from my brother's 30th birthday. It was then decided that I was going to finish his car, and surprise him for his 30th birthday with his completed project car.

## The Mission
Well hooley dooley was the next 8 weeks something else, the ammount of hours, blood, sweat, 40,000 volt electrical shocks, eye sweats (not tears I swear) that was put into this project was like nothing I have ever done before. I started off googling all the specifics required for the conversion, and started ordering parts from Gumtree/Ebay/Amazon like crazy.

Along the way I noticed more and more missing parts, and also some parts being extremly diffuclt to find. Halfway through the project, my Mum requested (family was in on it) that I got some back seats for the sierra (They were thrown out previously), This was next to impossible to find. I ended up finding a young lady that was selling some in rural NSW, organised Toll to pick them up, had them in a couple of days! Other parts I had to scavenge was a front bumper (Rural Queensland) and also a rear bumper (Hens teeth for this model, ended up finding one in rural Tasmania!) Maybe I should have gone into parts procurement?

Eventually, I had all the bits I needed, so I statrted eating my peanuts and doing the wrench monkey stuff. A lot of the conversion information I followed was posted by a user called 'masterA' on auszookers.com, this can be found [Here](https://www.auszookers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=36242)

## Just call me Picasso!(?)
I had a few bits and pieces that needed painting! The side skirts on these Sierras are a plastic strip, and its awfulyl common for rust to form behind these. Low and behold, there was rust on this one, and my brother started the body work a long time ago. I smoothed out he fiberglass reinforced body filler, and slapped some paint on that bad boy, also doing the rear bumper at the same time. While I was at it, I also throw a pretty gunmetal grey at the rims!


## I need a holiday
It was 2 weeks until D-Day, and still hadn't driven the car, and there was a list which would make grown men cry. I ended up asking my boss for a week off, he was concerned with my short notice, "Is everything ok?" he asked in a worried tone, I let him know the situation, and he smirked and wished me luck. 

I ended up working this entire week from 8am-midnight, sometimes creeping a bit further into the AM's, tightening every bolt, securing every cable, fitting all the accessories that my brother had bought over the years. Lightbars, dual battery kits, fuelpump for long range tank, completely rewiring the rear lights, troubleshooting peculiar electrical issues. To this day, I still dont know how I managed to find the motivation and energy to keep going, but I managed.

## Lets get creative

-Write about 3d printed throttle body adapter

## Number Five is alive
(reference to Short Circuit, a fantastic film from 1985 about a an experimental robot in a lab that is electrocuted, suddenly becomes intelligent, and escapes.)
The car is running, I can drive it around the block, the lights work, it starts, it stops, everything is buttoned up, tidied up, all the temporary bodge jobs for testing were removed and  I have about 12 hours before I leave for a 4 hour journey to suprise my brother

-Write about the maiden voyage
