# "Remember when?"
The process of upgrading the motor in my brother's SJ70 Suzuki Sierra

## The story

Well, well, well. About time I wrote some of this stuff down. I was sitting on a train the other day - Scrolling though photos, and I suddenly realised that ive done some pretty cool projects (If I say so myself!) So I started moving photos into albums so that I could get  some pen to paper (fingers to keyboard?) and write my experience down so I can share with others, and also keep as a memory!

Sooooooomewhere around 2011, my Brother purchased his Suzuki sierra, and he loved this thing. Small-form 4X4, coming in at 950kg, packing a massive 1.3L 62.5kW carby engine. The car was awesome to drive! And my brother and I spent nemourous weekends out camping and fishing. Attenting the annual Kingston surf fishing competition each year.

One beautiful summers day, we were out with a bunch of people, and we jumped the car what ill call a "brave" distance!

After this stunt, and coming out mostly unscathed (Minus a bent front differential housing), the car was taken off the road for a few major upgrades.

## The Original Plan
The original plan was big!

-1.6L EFI engine from a Suzuki Vitara

-Suzuki Swift GTI DOHC head

-Ebay turbo

All of it was coming along (slowly but surely), I remember Mum and Dad getting awfully excited when the engine came out of the shed and rolled towards the car for the first time!

The project sat around for a while, my brother got married, moved out of Mum and Dad's house into his own home, and started a family. Soon, time became a precious resource. In the middle of all this, I had moved up to Adelaide, tried out uni (Robotic Engineering), turns out uni wasnt for me, so I jumped into a trade, working as an apprentice motor mechanic for Mercedes Benz. I eventually conviced my brother to send up his car to me, so that I could finish it off for him in my spare time. 

We discussed the plan, and decided to simplify things. The plan changed to just drop in a complete 1.3L EFI engine from a Suzuki Swift GTI, bringing him up to 74kW. This simplified the conversion significantly, as it's a direct bolt up to the existing drivetrain, and there was atleast ***some*** scattered documentation available online from other people who have completed this.

As some parts were missing, I ended up grabing a complete ending from a wreck for ~$500ish. Sent the engine wiring loom and the cluster off to [Camms Wiring Solutions](https://www.facebook.com/cammswiringsolutions/) for him to work his magic.
