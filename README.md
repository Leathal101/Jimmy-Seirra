# "Remember when?"
The process of upgrading the motor in my brother's SJ70 Suzuki Sierra

## The Story

Well, well, well. About time I wrote some of this stuff down. I was sitting on a train the other day - Scrolling though photos, and I suddenly realised that I’ve done some pretty cool projects (If I say so myself!) So I started moving photos into albums so that I could get  some pen to paper (fingers to keyboard?) and write my experience down so I can share with others, and also keep as a memory!

Sooooooomewhere around 2011, my Brother purchased his Suzuki sierra, and he loved this thing. Small-form 4X4, coming in at 950kg, packing a massive 1.3L 62.5kW carby engine. The car was awesome to drive! And my brother and I spent numerous weekends out camping and fishing, including attesting the annual Kingston surf fishing competition each year.

One beautiful summers day, we were out with a bunch of people, and we jumped the car what ill call a "brave" distance!

After this stunt, and coming out mostly unscathed (Minus a bent front differential housing), the car was taken off the road for a few major upgrades.

## The Original Plan
The original plan was big!

-1.6L EFI engine from a Suzuki Vitara

-Suzuki Swift GTI DOHC head

-Ebay turbo (heh)

All of it was coming along (slowly but surely), I remember Mum and Dad getting awfully excited when the engine came out of the shed and rolled towards the car for the first time!

The project sat around for a while, my brother got married, moved out of Mum and Dad's house into his own home, and started a family. Soon, time became a precious resource. In the middle of all this, I had moved up to Adelaide, tried out uni (Robotic Engineering), turns out uni wasn’t for me, so I jumped into a trade, working as an apprentice motor mechanic for Mercedes Benz. I eventually convinced my brother to send up his car to me, so that I could finish it off for him in my spare time. 

## The Handover

We discussed the plan, and decided to simplify things. The plan changed to just drop in a complete 1.3L EFI engine from a Suzuki Swift GTI, bringing him up to 74kW. This simplified the conversion significantly, as it's a direct bolt up to the existing drivetrain, and there was at-least ***some*** scattered documentation available online from other people who have completed this.

As some parts were missing, I ended up grabbing a complete engine from a wreck for ~$500ish. Sent the engine wiring loom and the cluster off to [Camms Wiring Solutions](https://www.facebook.com/cammswiringsolutions/) for him to work his magic. As life being as life doing/does, this project fell off my priority list as I moved houses and other priorities came up. Suddenly, I found myself in a similar situation as my brother, time becoming a precious resource. At the same time, I was trying to work a 9-5 as a mechanic, and also do after hours "Cashies" so I had an extra bit of pocket money.

Time was fleeing, one Sunday morning I was having a coffee out the back of the house with my partner, and we decided that the car had to go. Well, not "go", but I had to dedicate some serious time to finishing this car. This was about 8 weeks out from my brother's 30th birthday. It was then decided that I was going to finish his car, and surprise him for his 30th birthday with his completed project car.

## The Mission
Well hooley dooley was the next 8 weeks something else, the amount of hours, blood, sweat, 40,000 volt electrical shocks, eye sweats (not tears I swear) that was put into this project was like nothing I have ever done before. I started off googling all the specifics required for the conversion, and started ordering parts from Gumtree/Ebay/Amazon like crazy.

Along the way I noticed more and more missing parts, and also some parts being extremely difficult to find. Halfway through the project, my Mum requested (family was in on it) that I got some back seats for the sierra (They were thrown out previously), This was next to impossible to find. I ended up finding a young lady that was selling some in rural NSW, organised Toll to pick them up, had them in a couple of days! Other parts I had to scavenge was a front bumper (Rural Queensland) and also a rear bumper (Hens teeth for this model, ended up finding one in rural Tasmania!) Maybe I should have gone into parts procurement?

Eventually, I had all the bits I needed, so I started eating my peanuts and doing the wrench monkey stuff. A lot of the conversion information I followed was posted by a user called 'masterA' on auszookers.com, this can be found [Here](https://www.auszookers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=36242)

## Just call me Picasso!(?)
I had a few bits and pieces that needed painting! The side skirts on these Sierras are a plastic strip, and its awfully common for rust to form behind these. Low and behold, there was rust on this one, and my brother started the body work a long time ago. I smoothed out he fibreglass reinforced body filler, and slapped some paint on that bad boy, also doing the rear bumper at the same time. While I was at it, I also throw a pretty gunmetal grey at the rims!


## I need a holiday
It was 2 weeks until D-Day, and still hadn't driven the car, and there was a list which would make grown men cry. I ended up asking my boss for a week off, he was concerned with my short notice, "Is everything ok?" he asked in a worried tone, I let him know the situation, and he smirked and wished me luck. 

I ended up working this entire week from 8am-midnight, sometimes creeping a bit further into the AM's, tightening every bolt, securing every cable, fitting all the accessories that my brother had bought over the years, a lightbar, dual battery kits, fuel pump for long range tank, completely rewiring the rear lights, troubleshooting peculiar electrical issues. To this day, I still don't know how I managed to find the motivation and energy to keep going, but I managed.

## Lets get creative

There were a few timea where I had to get creating, and just fabricate a solution as an off the shelf option dodnt exist. Creating a mount
for the fuel pump, installing accessories, running all the wiring, there are a few examples of where I had to think outside the box.

one that I am particulatly proud of would be the throttle body adapter. the goal was to have this new engine connected up to the snorkel so that my brother could continut his 4X4 adventures. I was currenty dealing with an issue, i needed to connect the Suzuki Swift GTI engine up to the stndard airbox that was connected to the snorkel. The GTI throttle body was a swure flange, so i couldnt just slap a put of pipe on it, and getting it
cut and welding on some alloy piping was well beyond my extertise at the time. I had done some CAD works over the years, so i sketched up a 3d mode, and got a friend to print it
out. This worked perfectly! I was then able to use some flexible tubing to connect this all together!

## Number Five is alive
(Reference to "Short Circuit," a fantastic film from 1985 about an experimental robot in a lab that is electrocuted, suddenly becomes intelligent, and escapes.) The car is running; I can drive it around the block, the lights work, it starts, it stops, everything is mostly buttoned up, tidied up, all the temporary bodge jobs for testing were removed, and I have about 12 hours before I leave for a 4-hour journey to surprise my brother. I was missing the gear shifter boot, so at about 8 pm, without extended testing, I drove 30 minutes through suburbia to pick up this part from Facebook Marketplace, drove back, no issues.

I then proceeded to get the most amount of sleep I have gotten in weeks (probably 6 hours) and started the true "road test," which consisted of a 4-hour road trip to a coastal town where we have an annual family catch-up weekend. The drive was tough only due to sleep deprivation; the car didn't miss a beat, apart from me thinking I punched a hole in the fuel tank (the fuel gauge was doing funny things).

I probably got there around lunchtime, and my brother wasn't due to arrive until about 6 pm or so. I hid the car behind the cabin I was staying in so that he couldn't see it.

He arrived with his family. I remember sitting down and having dinner with him first, asking how I've been. I distinctly remember him asking how I have been, and I replied with "I've been heaps busy working on cars at home." He replied with a cheeky, joking tone, "Working on the Zook?" I disarmed the situation and let him know I have been working on other project cars (my family were eyeing each other as they couldn't wait to surprise him with his car).

Eventually, Mum said, "Let's go check out Lethal101's cabin." We made our way over there, and my brother was clueless. I will pop in a few screenshots of a video which was taken as we arrived, but I'll forever remember the smile on his face when we walked behind the cabin and I pulled the car cover off.

We had a fantastic weekend together; my brother was forever grateful, and I was glad to see a few months of blood, sweat, and tears all be worth it by seeing how happy it made my brother.


## Lets close this out

I learnt a few things from this project
- Do good onto those who do good upon you
- Dont take on other people projects 
- Measure twice, cut once

Manor shoutout to my wonderful partner, who took care of me during the crazy last 2 weeks and looking after my sleep deprived self. Second me tions to my
family for keeping this all a secret. What a wild ride, id like to say if this came up again, I woulsnt do it. But something inside of me just wouldnt be anle to resist.
