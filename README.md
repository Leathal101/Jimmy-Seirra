# "Remember when?"
The process of upgrading the motor in my brother's SJ70 Suzuki Sierra
### The story

Well, well, well. About time I wrote some of this stuff down. I was sitting on a train the other day - Scrolling though photos, and I suddenly realised that ive done some pretty cool projects (If I say so myself!) So I started moving photos into albums so that I could get  some pen to paper (fingers to keyboard?) and write my experience down so I can share with others, and also keep as a memory!

Sooooooomewhere around 2011, my Brother purchased his Suzuki sierra, and he loved this thing. Small-form 4X4, coming in at 950kg, packing a massive 1.3L 62.5kW carby engine. The car was awesome to drive! And my brother and I spent nemourous weekends out camping and fishing. Attenting the annual Kingston surf fishing competition each year.

One beautiful summers day, we were out with a bunch of people, and we jumped the car what ill call a "brave" distance!

After this stunt, and coming out mostly unscathed (Minus a bent front differential housing), the car was taken off the road for a few major upgrades.

## The Original Plan
The original plan was big!
-1.6L EFI engine from a Suzuki Vitara
-Suzuki Swift GTI DOHC head
-Ebay turbo

All of it was coming along (slowly but surely), I remember Mum and Dad getting awfully excited when the engine came out of the shed and rolled towards the car
