# "Remember when?"
The process of upgrading the motor in my brother's SJ70 Suzuki Sierra

## The Story

Well, well, well. About time I wrote some of this stuff down. I was sitting on a train the other day - Scrolling though photos, and I suddenly realised that ive done some pretty cool projects (If I say so myself!) So I started moving photos into albums so that I could get  some pen to paper (fingers to keyboard?) and write my experience down so I can share with others, and also keep as a memory!

Sooooooomewhere around 2011, my Brother purchased his Suzuki sierra, and he loved this thing. Small-form 4X4, coming in at 950kg, packing a massive 1.3L 62.5kW carby engine. The car was awesome to drive! And my brother and I spent nemourous weekends out camping and fishing. Attenting the annual Kingston surf fishing competition each year.

One beautiful summers day, we were out with a bunch of people, and we jumped the car what ill call a "brave" distance!

After this stunt, and coming out mostly unscathed (Minus a bent front differential housing), the car was taken off the road for a few major upgrades.

## The Original Plan
The original plan was big!

-1.6L EFI engine from a Suzuki Vitara

-Suzuki Swift GTI DOHC head

-Ebay turbo (heh)

All of it was coming along (slowly but surely), I remember Mum and Dad getting awfully excited when the engine came out of the shed and rolled towards the car for the first time!

The project sat around for a while, my brother got married, moved out of Mum and Dad's house into his own home, and started a family. Soon, time became a precious resource. In the middle of all this, I had moved up to Adelaide, tried out uni (Robotic Engineering), turns out uni wasnt for me, so I jumped into a trade, working as an apprentice motor mechanic for Mercedes Benz. I eventually conviced my brother to send up his car to me, so that I could finish it off for him in my spare time. 

## The Handover

We discussed the plan, and decided to simplify things. The plan changed to just drop in a complete 1.3L EFI engine from a Suzuki Swift GTI, bringing him up to 74kW. This simplified the conversion significantly, as it's a direct bolt up to the existing drivetrain, and there was atleast ***some*** scattered documentation available online from other people who have completed this.

As some parts were missing, I ended up grabing a complete engine from a wreck for ~$500ish. Sent the engine wiring loom and the cluster off to [Camms Wiring Solutions](https://www.facebook.com/cammswiringsolutions/) for him to work his magic. As life being as life doing/does, this project fell off my priority list as I moved houses and other priorities came up. Suddenly, I found myself in a similar situation as my brother, time becoming a precious resource. At the same time, I was trying to work a 9-5 as a mechanic, and also do after hours "Cashies" so I had an extra bit of pocket money.

Time was fleeing, one sunday morning I was having a coffee out the back of the house with my partner, and we decided that the car had to go. Well, not "go", but I had to dedicate some serious time to finishing this car. This was about 8 weeks out from my brother's 30th birthday. It was then decided that I was going to finish his car, and surprise him for his 30th birthday with his completed project car.

## The Mission
Well hooley dooley was the next 8 weeks something else, the ammount of hours, blood, sweat, 40,000 volt electrical shocks, eye sweats (not tears I swear) that was put into this project was like nothing I have ever done before. I started off googling all the specifics required for the conversion, and started ordering parts from Gumtree/Ebay/Amazon like crazy.

Along the way I noticed more and more missing parts, and also some parts being extremly diffuclt to find. Halfway through the project, my Mum requested (family was in on it) that I got some back seats for the sierra (They were thrown out previously), This was next to impossible to find. I ended up finding a young lady that was selling some in rural NSW, organised Toll to pick them up, had them in a couple of days! Other parts I had to scavenge was a front bumper (Rural Queensland) and also a rear bumper (Hens teeth for this model, ended up finding one in rural Tasmania!) Maybe I should have gone into parts procurement?

Eventually, I had all the bits I needed, so I statrted eating my peanuts and doing the wrench monkey stuff. A lot of the conversion information I followed was posted by a user called 'masterA' on auszookers.com, this can be found [Here](https://www.auszookers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=36242)
